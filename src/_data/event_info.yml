  "SB Hacks is a 36-hour hackathon annually by students at University of California,
  Santa Barbara. Normally the event takes place on campus, but this year, we are going digital! SB Hacks aims to
  expose college students to the technology industry and provide the necessary resources ot get hands-on experience
  in coding. Whether you are a first-time coder or a seasoned hacker, we encourage you to enter
  SB Hacks with enthusiasm and curiosity. Our hope is that you challenge yourself with a fun project, learn something new along
  the way, and are proud of what you have accomplished at the end of it all."
